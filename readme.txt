== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find my Infusionsoft App Name? =

Your Infusionsoft App Name is whatever comes before infusionsoft.com when you are logging into your application. For example, if you log into "example.infusionsoft.com," then your Infusionsoft App Name would be "example".

= How about my Web Tracking Code? = 

In Infusionsoft's Spring 2012 release and later, you can find your Web Tracking Code by clicking the main menu, selecting "Marketing" > "Web Analytics" and clicking then "Get Tracking Code" button. You can copy/paste the Web Tracking Code from that page (don't paste the whole script tag!) and there's an image on the plugin settings page to help if you get stuck.
